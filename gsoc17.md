# GSoC 17 Project: Visualization components for App Inventor

## Project Overview

Visualization components are components for App Inventor that can make data plots from user data. In my project, I implemented three kinds of chart: Pie Chart, Bar Chart and Line Chart. I used the library [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) for implementation.

## Design Document 

In this document I explained my design decisions of the components, and it contains the API Documentation of the components I created. Some feedback from user is also included.
